### How to run

You need to install the Google Cloud SDK.
Visit the https://cloud.google.com/sdk/downloads and follow 'Interactive installer'
After installation, open a command prompt and run the following for installing java components:
gcloud components install app-engine-java

Unzip the downloaded example, move to the root directory, and run the following at a command prompt:
mvn appengine:run

If you see the "Dev App Server is now running" message at the command prompt, visit the http://localhost:8080 in a browser.
